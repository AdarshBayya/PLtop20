# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize team performances in the English Premier League across 20 seasons (2000â€“2022). This includes identifying trends in points, wins, losses, goal differences, goals scored, and positions achieved by the teams. The analysis identifies the most successful teams over time and provides insights into which teams have consistently performed well or struggled in the league.

# Visualizations and Analysis

# Correlation Matrix
The correlation matrix highlights the relationships between various numerical metrics (e.g., points, goals, wins, losses). It provides insights into how these metrics influence each other.

# Heatmap
A heatmap is used to visualize the correlation matrix, where each cell shows the strength of correlation between metrics.

# Points per Season
A line plot visualizes the points accumulated by teams across different seasons, allowing you to track trends over time.
X-axis: Season
Y-axis: Points

# Top Teams Analysis
This section identifies and visualizes the top teams based on their finishing positions in the league.

The dataset 20seasons.csv contains team performance metrics from Premier League seasons between 2000 and 2022. Each row in the dataset represents a team's performance in a particular season, with columns such as:

Season: The season year (e.g., 2000-2001)
Team: The name of the team
Pos: Final league position
Pts: Total points
W: Wins
D: Draws
L: Losses
GF: Goals For
GA: Goals Against
GD: Goal Difference
